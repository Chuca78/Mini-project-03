# Random password generator

## Description

This is the mini project 03 for the UT Austin coding boot camp. I was given the index.html, style.css, and a basic framework in the script.js for a website that only showed text and styling, with no functionality. This type of project is called an "on the job ticket" where I was given existing code and the challenge was to refactor the code to make the website work. The challenge for this project was to create a random password generator that accepts length and character requirements from the user. First I created a prompt for the length of password (within 8 and 128 characters) and used a window alert to tell the user if the length was accepted. Next I created user prompts for the four types of characters that the password could include. Lastly I created the random password generator that ensures that the user gets at least one of each type of character selected.

## Usage

This website is designed to show my proficiency in "on the job tickets" and my ability to refactor existing code while satisfying the user story and acceptance criteria. This website can be used to generate random passwords of lengths between 8 and 128 characters, while using user input to include characters of their choice (choice of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters).The external URL for this password generator is:
